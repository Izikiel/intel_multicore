Pure64 is a second stage bootloader for 64-bit PC's with compatible Intel or
AMD processors. The loader gets the computer into a full 64-bit state with no
legacy compatibility layers. Pure64 also enables and configures all available
Cores/CPUs in the computer. An information table is stored in memory after
Pure64 is finished that stores important details about the computer.

This distribution contains the Pure64 second stage boot loader. It also
contains some example software that Pure64 can load as well as the FAT16
bootsector that loads Pure64.
