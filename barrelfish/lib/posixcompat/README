libposixcompat for Barrelfish

INTRODUCTION

libposixcompat strives to provide IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) support in
Barrelfish.

Many things are still unimplemented, but a decent set of functionality
exists. Features that are absent or do not work as expected shall be
noted in this document, in the following section.


CAVEATS

errno reporting is very scarce. All functions will return the proper
error return code on error (in genereal -1), but the errno variable is
only set appropriately in very few cases.

fork() and exec() are not existing. However, this has not been a huge
problem so far.

getpid() and getppid() will return fake IDs of 3 and 2, respectively,
if they are not provided with IDs.


CONVENTIONS

The current working directory is stored and kept up-to-date in the
environment variable CWD, which is also inherited to newly spawned
programs.

getppid() expects to find the parent process ID in the environment
variable PPID. This variable can be inherited into the child upon
spawning.

getpid() uses the domain ID for the process ID, except if it's zero.
