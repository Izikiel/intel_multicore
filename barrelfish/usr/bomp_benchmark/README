libbomp Benchmarks
==================

This is a subset of the benchmarks contained in the "NAS Parallel
Benchmarks 2.3 OpenMP C version" benchmark suite (see
http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/NPB/).

The EP, BT, LU, MG and SP benchmarks are currently excluded because
they use features not currently supported by libbomp or Barrelfish
(like Thread-Local Storage or file operations).

Linux Version
=============

A Linux Makefile is provided to easily build the benchmarks using both
libGOMP and libbomp for easy cross-comparison of benchmark results
between libGOMP, libbomp, Linux and Barrelfish.
